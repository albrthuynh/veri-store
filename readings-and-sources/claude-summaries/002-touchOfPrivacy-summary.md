## Abstract and Introduction

This research addresses a critical challenge in biometric authentication: protecting fingerprint data privacy while maintaining high recognition accuracy. The paper presents a novel framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable secure fingerprint authentication where all computations occur on encrypted data, preventing raw biometric exposure throughout the authentication process.

The system achieves remarkable performance metrics: 99.06% test accuracy, 99.19% True Acceptance Rate (TAR), 0.81% False Rejection Rate (FRR), 0% False Acceptance Rate (FAR), 100% True Rejection Rate (TRR), and a minimal Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.40%. Despite a 157.26× encryption overhead, the system remains practical for real-time applications, completing encrypted comparisons in 0.025 seconds with total processing time of 0.136 seconds per fingerprint.

## Problem Statement and Motivation

### Biometric Recognition Challenges

Fingerprint authentication offers significant advantages over traditional password-based systems: fingerprints cannot be lost, forgotten, or easily shared, making them highly reliable for identity verification. However, deep learning-based biometric systems raise critical security and privacy concerns:

**Key vulnerabilities:**
- **Immutability**: Once compromised, biometric data cannot be changed like passwords
- **Reconstruction attacks**: Unprotected templates can be exploited to reconstruct original fingerprints
- **Identity theft**: Stolen biometric data enables permanent impersonation attacks
- **Regulatory compliance**: GDPR classifies biometric information as sensitive data requiring robust protection

### Traditional Biometric Template Protection (BTP) Limitations

According to ISO/IEC 24745 standards, robust BTP schemes must ensure:

1. **Irreversibility**: Computationally infeasible to derive meaningful biometric information from protected templates
2. **Unlinkability**: Templates stored across different applications must remain uncorrelated
3. **Renewability**: Compromised templates should be replaceable without matching previous ones

**Existing approaches face significant challenges:**

**Cancelable Biometrics:**
- Apply distortions to fingerprint features before storage
- Often suffer from performance degradation
- Difficult to balance security and accuracy

**Cryptobiometrics:**
- Combine fingerprint data with cryptographic techniques
- Require auxiliary data (AD) for verification
- Increased vulnerability to attacks through AD

## Proposed Solution: Homomorphic Encryption Integration

### Core Concept

The paper proposes using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as an alternative to traditional BTP schemes. FHE enables computations directly on encrypted biometric data without decryption, ensuring raw fingerprint data remains protected throughout its lifecycle.

**Key advantages:**
- No decryption during processing
- End-to-end privacy preservation
- Eliminates auxiliary data requirements
- Maintains verification accuracy

### Homomorphic Encryption Schemes

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):**
- Supports arbitrary number of computations on encrypted data
- Enables secure processing without decryption
- Computationally expensive due to bootstrapping operations
- Used in this research via CKKS scheme

**Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE):**
- Allows limited number of operations before requiring decryption
- More efficient than FHE but unsuitable for complex computations
- Useful for simple biometric authentication scenarios

## System Architecture and Methodology

### Three-Entity Framework

The system operates with clear separation of responsibilities:

**1. Client (User):**
- Collects fingerprint samples
- Extracts features using CNN model
- Encrypts feature vectors locally using FHE
- Performs encrypted similarity computation
- Sends encrypted similarity score to authentication server
- Maintains exclusive access to decryption key

**2. Database Server:**
- Stores only encrypted fingerprint templates E(T_r)
- Retrieves encrypted templates upon request
- Never accesses plaintext biometric data
- Maintains template database security

**3. Authentication Server:**
- Receives encrypted similarity scores from client
- Decrypts scores using secret key
- Compares decrypted scores to predefined threshold
- Returns accept/deny decision to client
- Makes final authentication decision

### Dataset and Data Preparation

**SOCOFing Dataset:**
- 6,000 fingerprint images from 600 African individuals
- Each subject contributes 10 distinct fingerprints
- All subjects 18 years or older
- 500dpi resolution
- Synthetically altered versions using STRANGE toolbox

**Alterations include:**
- Obliteration
- Central rotation  
- Z-cut
- Three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard

**Distribution:**
- 17,934 altered images (easy)
- 17,067 altered images (medium)

- 90 individuals selected
- 7,200 training images (8 variations per fingerprint across difficulty levels)
- One real fingerprint per person for verification
- Data split: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing

### Preprocessing and Normalization

**Min-max normalization applied:**

```
X' = a + (X - X_min)(b - a) / (X_max - X_min)
```

where:
- X is original feature value
- X' is normalized value (scaled to [0, 1])
- X_min and X_max are dataset minimum and maximum values

**Benefits:**
- Numerical stability for CKKS encryption
- Promotes model convergence
- Preserves raw fingerprint data integrity
- Enhances efficiency of encrypted computations

**Integer scaling:**
- Features normalized to [0, 1] then scaled to [0, 10³]
- Retains precision while maintaining small intermediate values
- Optimizes homomorphic encryption performance

## Homomorphic Encryption Implementation

### CKKS Encryption Scheme (via TenSEAL)

**Why CKKS?**
- Supports approximate arithmetic on encrypted floating-point values
- Enables fully homomorphic operations
- Optimized for deep learning applications
- Better suited than Paillier (partially homomorphic)

**Key generation:**
- Public key (pk): Encrypts fingerprint features
- Secret key (sk): Decrypts encrypted data
- Keys ensure only authorized access

### Encryption Process

**Feature vector encryption:**

```
E(F_U) = Encrypt(F_U, pk)
```

where F_U is the unencrypted fingerprint feature vector.

**Homomorphic operations:**
- Addition: E(d) + E(d') = E(d + d')
- Scalar multiplication: b · E(d) = E(b · d)
- Enables computations without revealing data

**Decryption:**

```
F_U = Decrypt(E(F_U), sk)
```

### Distance Computation in Encrypted Domain

**Two metrics implemented:**

#### 1. Encrypted Euclidean Distance

**Squared Euclidean distance formula:**

```
S_euc = Σ(f²_U,f + t²_D,f - 2·f_U,f·t_D,f)
```

**Homomorphic computation:**

```
E(S_euc) = Σ[E(f_U,f) ⊙ E(f_U,f)] + Σ[E(t_D,f) ⊙ E(t_D,f)] - 2·Σ[E(f_U,f) ⊙ E(t_D,f)]
```

where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication.

**Advantages:**
- No square root required (computationally expensive in encrypted domain)
- Maintains accuracy
- Efficient for encrypted operations

#### 2. Encrypted Cosine Similarity

**Cosine similarity formula:**

```
d_cos(F_U, T_D) = Σ(f_U,f·t_D,f) / (|F_U| · |T_D|)
```

**Scaled for encryption:**

```
S_cos = 10¹²·d_cos(F_U, T_D)
```

**Homomorphic computation:**

```
E(S_cos) = Σ[E(f_U,f) ⊙ E(t_D,f)] / (|E(F_U)| · |E(T_D)|)
```

**Comparison with Euclidean:**
- Lower EER but higher computational cost
- Plaintext response: 0.00018s
- Encrypted response: 0.028s (156× slower)
- Euclidean chosen for better balance of accuracy and efficiency

### Security Parameters

## Privacy-Preserving Verification Protocol

### Authentication Workflow

**1. Feature Extraction and Encryption:**
- User extracts fingerprint features F_U using CNN model
- Feature vector encrypted: E(F_U) = E(F_U, pk)
- Encrypted vector sent to authentication server

**2. Encrypted Matching:**
- Authentication server retrieves encrypted stored template T_D from database
- Both encrypted vectors E(F_U) and T_D processed in homomorphic environment
- Encrypted similarity score computed: E(S_dist) = D_dist(E(F_U), T_D)

**3. Secure Decision Making:**
- Encrypted similarity score E(S_dist) sent back to user
- User decrypts similarity score using secret key
- Score compared against predefined threshold δ
- Authentication successful if S_dist > δ, otherwise denied

### Threat Model and Security Assumptions

**Honest-but-curious model:**
- Authentication and database servers follow protocol correctly
- May attempt to infer sensitive information from encrypted data

**Privacy safeguards:**
- User encrypts feature vectors before transmission
- Both servers work exclusively with encrypted vectors E(F)
- No raw biometric data or plaintext features ever exposed
- All matching and distance computations performed on encrypted data

**Security assumptions:**
- Authentication server never learns plaintext feature vectors or templates
- Database server stores only encrypted templates, no raw biometric access
- User never receives plaintext templates from database server
- Authentication and database servers do not collude
- Breaking FHE encryption without secret key is computationally infeasible

### ISO/IEC 24745 Compliance

- Based on hardness of Learning With Errors (LWE) problem
- Prevents reconstruction attacks

**Unlinkability:**
- Fingerprint templates encrypted with different keys remain uncorrelated
- Semantic security against chosen-plaintext attacks
- Probabilistic encryption ensures different ciphertexts for same data:
  E_pk1(T_r, s1) ≠ E_pk1(T_r, s2)
- Prevents cross-matching attacks across applications

**Renewability:**
- New key pair (sk, pk) can be generated if templates compromised
- Entire database re-encrypted without requiring new biometric samples
- System remains secure without forcing users to provide additional data
- Addresses limitation of traditional cancelable biometric systems

**Attack resistance:**
